                <h4>In my first year of university, I had the opportunity to create a 'Car Betting Simulation Game' for my final project in my "Object Oriented Programming" module. This project was worth 40% of our final grade. </h4>
            
                <h4> I spent several weeks trying to implement differnet types of OOP into my game. The game is based around the users choice, whatever the user does can affect the outcome. So the user can select which car they would like to choose e.g. 'Ford', 'Mercedes', 'BMW'. Then they could choose to add mods or not and this would subsquently affect the overall horsepower of the vehicle. Then the user would choose which car to bet on and then the amount. Then the race would commence with commentary also depending on the users choices. Finally, at the end, it would show the user how much they won/loss depending on how much they bet and the odds of the vehicle actually betted on!</h4>

        <h3><i>Nemeziz</i></h3>
        <class class = "container2">
            <br>
            <h4>In my own time I have also been developing a personal game called Nemeziz. This was a personal project I began over the summer of 2019 and is still going strong. The game took inspiration from multiple games such as Hitman and FPS games like Counter Strike: Global Offensive. The main idea behind the game is the mix of multiplayer and AI Detection implemented into the game.  </h4>
            <h4>The Nemeziz AI is a detection based robot, in which when the user goes into the vicinty of the light the colour of said light changes to red and alerts nearby users that the player has been detected. There's also weapons in the game (Primary & Secondary Weapon) that can be used to destroy the AI robots aswell as the interactive objects within the world. There is also an advanced movement system within the game which includes movement such as: Sliding, WallRunning, WallJumping, and more. Users can register and then login to the server and then play with friends. The game is still in alpha therefore theres still lots of features that are currently being implemented and when the game is entering beta this will also be announnced to allow users to test the servers.</h4>
