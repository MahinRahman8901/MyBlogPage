                <p>My Aim after my degree is to be a software engineer and to potentially work in one of the top 5 companies in London. In order to do this I am currently on track to receive a 1st in my First Year and hope to take this forward into my next two years and finish with a 1st in Computer Science. This will potentially give me the edge over my peers.</p>
